Step 3. WordPress Shortcode
Now that we have made the changes to the age, we then need to use this data in a WordPress shortcode to display it as a list within the front-end of a WordPress website. Using what you have already created from Step 2 let's echo the peoples information. For this task you will need to:

Create a WordPress shortcode which can be called using standard shortcode syntax ([shortcode])
Make use of the code you created from Step 2 to echo out each persons details as a HTML list just as you did in Step 1.
Notes
Make sure that you structure the list the same as you created in Step 1. so that the CSS will still work using the shortcode.
Include your stylesheet links using the standard WordPress style enqueuing function.
Please include the shortcode functionality as a single file rather than a whole WordPress installation when sending your files back.
